For this project, we will be scraping data from GitHub repository README files. The goal is to build a model that can predict which programming language a repository is using, given the text of the README file.

Rejects non-ascii README files(i.e. foriegn languages)

Classification Models Used:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- KNN
